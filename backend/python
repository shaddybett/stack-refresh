python interpreter - Program that executes python code
An expresson is a piece of code that produces a value
Syntax is basically grammar for instance if we execute an expression like 2 > we get a syntax error since 
we did not provide a comparison value
For development process we can use a code editor or an Integrated Development Environment(IDE)
An IDE is basically a code editor with additional features like autocompletion and debugging features an example is
pycharm. 
Python Enhancement Proposals(PEP)
<!-- Python Implementations -->
When we talk about python, we mean two things that are closely related: Python language and python implementation
Python language defines a set of rules that guides us to write python code and python implementation is a program that
understands those rules and execute python code. The default python impementation is CPython which is basically a program
written in C langauge. Other implentations include Jython written in Java, IronPython written in C# and PyPy written in a
subset of python
<!-- How is python code executed -->
Programming languages like java,python,c etc are simple languages that we understand but computers do not. Computers only 
understand machine code therefore we use complilers to convert langauges to machine codes.
Machine codes are specific to the type of CPU of the computer meaning if we compile a C code on a windows machine, we can't
execute it on macos for example because different OS have different machine code just like how different people speak different
languages. Java however came to solve this problem whereby java compiler does not compile java code into machine but into a portable
language called Java Bytecode which is not specific to any particular OS. To convert Java Bytecode to machine code, we use Java Virtual Machine(JVM)
